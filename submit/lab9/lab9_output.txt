EXERCISE 2:

Discover the Mask and Exlain:
	 The mask is 0x7fffff
	 The reason I know this is the mask is because in the obj dump file, on line 'a' the code
	 'ands' a value stored in a register with 0x7fffff. That is how I found out the value


EXERCISE 4:

You need to print out the variable as a pointer because pointers are totally untyped.
Since we passed "joe" in as the argument, we need to let gdb know that the value in the register is a pointer to a String/Char pointer
so instead of doing:

p $rsi

We had to do:

p (char *)($rsi)

To reiterate, the value in $rsi is a pointer, but gdb doesn't know that, so we have to explicitly tell gdb that
so that gbb can properly output it
